# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - I feel mostly comfortable with the each method in terms of what was taught today. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I feel that my time was productive, as so far they are not new concepts to me. It was fun to be able to practice again these concepts.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - Not much in terms of the `each` method's basic use and syntax, but more of how to be creative with what I can do with it! I will refer to the Ruby documentation for further reading in my time outside of assignments.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - None for now..
